### ðŸš€ Engineering Impact  
I architect React/TypeScript systems that solve **business-critical challenges** through technical innovation and UX excellence:  

- **Telecom Transformation**: Unified 500K+ B2B users with microfrontend architecture (React/TS), boosting retention by 35% through journey-driven UX  
- **Fintech Revolution**: Engineered real-time PIX payments (React+NestJS) slashing processing from *48hrsâ†’<5s*, capturing 40% new market share  
- **Performance Breakthroughs**: Optimized sales dashboards with Redis caching (52% latency drop at 250K+ concurrency) and achieved **16x faster loading** (28sâ†’1.7s) in delivery platforms  
- **Scalable Foundations**: Built design systems serving 20+ products using atomic patterns, Redux/Context state, and CI/CD pipelines
